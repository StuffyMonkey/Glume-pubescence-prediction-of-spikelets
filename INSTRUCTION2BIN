### Instructions for building and using binary file of model

If you want to build binary file to implement model for your project, you should follow these steps
1. Install pyinstaller and other libraries into your conda venv
2. Use command: 
	pyinstaller -F --hidden-import="sklearn.utils._typedefs" --hidden-import="sklearn.neighbors.typedefs" --hidden-import="sklearn.neighbors.quad_tree" --hidden-import="sklearn.tree._utils"  model.py
N.B. Here we use some hooks to collect manually all required modules, that weren't included by pyinstaller

For using bin file, there is the following command
CLASSIFICATION:
1. check option
	./model --help
2. run model
	./model --inp <full_path_to_image>
N.B. Results will be saved into txt file in format <full_path_to_image> <prediction>

Also some tips for executing segmentation model (check path into segmentation of images notebook)
SEGMENTATION:
1. check option 
	./infer --help
2. run model
	./infer -bone efficientnet-b2 -mn model_efficientnet-b2.bin --cuda --verbose -bs 32 -ip img.jpg -op .
